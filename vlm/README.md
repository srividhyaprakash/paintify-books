Video Frame Extractor is a Python script that extracts frames from a video file and saves them as individual image files.


Run the script with the following command:

```
python frame_extractor.py <video_path> <output_path>
```

Replace `<video_path>` with the path to your video file, and `<output_path>` with the desired location to save the frames. For example:


The frames will be extracted from the video and saved as individual JPEG images in the specified output folder.
